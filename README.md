# Hayat

Hayat is a project to translate between ancient Egyptian scripts—Hieroglyphic, Demotic, and Coptic—and modern languages like Arabic and English. The plan is to build both a web and mobile app that allows translation from images (camera/gallery), and expand to support other ancient languages in the future.

## Features
- Translate Hieroglyphic, Demotic, and Coptic to Arabic & English
- Web and Mobile platform support
- Image and photo (OCR) input
- Database-driven translation logic
- Plans to expand to Iraqi, Syrian, Phoenician, and ancient Chinese
